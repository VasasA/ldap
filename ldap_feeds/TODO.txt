- add ldap token evaluation to feeds such that multiple attributes can be parsed
- add functionality to populate user->data['ldap_user'] and other user populating data
- simpletests
- documenation of use cases
- inclusion of sample feeds as exportables
- deal with multivalued attributes. This is already built into tokenization and should be resolved from there by
    using token nameing structure there. See ldap_servers_token_tokenize_entry() function and https://backdropcms.org/project/ldap#tokens
-  create mapper for feeds user processor for user->data array
-  add mapper/processor hook for creating ldap authmapping option on importing. Does this need to extend user processor?
-  figure out how to programmatically call importer on user logon so importer can execute post logon
